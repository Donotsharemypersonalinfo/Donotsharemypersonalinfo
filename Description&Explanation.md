Overfittingdemo:
- Demonstrates overfitting by training a neural network on a small dataset, highlighting how the model can perform well on training data but struggle with unseen data (validation set). It includes visualizations to show the difference between training and validation loss.
- This example uses synthetic data to demonstrate overfitting. Users will see the training loss decrease, while validation loss eventually increases, a sign of overfitting. The accompanying plot visualizes this difference.
- We’re using a synthetic dataset (generated with code), so you don’t need an external dataset. The code uses np.linspace() to create input data and a simple linear equation with added noise to generate labels.

- Import? what is it?

   TensorFlow: An open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It's designed to handle large-scale numerical computations, especially those involving tensors (multidimensional arrays).
 It's particularly powerful for building and training deep neural networks. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple linear regression to complex computer vision and natural language processing models.

  NumPy: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient array operations, including mathematical functions like linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

  Matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It's used to create various types of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts. It offers a wide range of customization options to tailor plots to specific needs.

- How they work together?

   Data Preparation with NumPy: Data is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed using NumPy arrays.

  Model Building with TensorFlow: Neural networks or other machine learning models are defined and trained using TensorFlow's computational graph and automatic differentiation.

  Visualization with Matplotlib.pyplot: The results of the model, such as loss curves, accuracy metrics, or predictions, are visualized using Matplotlib.pyplot to gain insights and monitor the training process.

dropout_example:
 - This code showcases how adding a dropout layer to a neural network can help reduce overfitting. Dropout randomly "drops" neurons during training, forcing the model to rely less on any single neuron.
 - This tutorial includes an explanation of dropout and shows the improved generalization performance. Users can observe that dropout leads to more balanced training and validation losses.
 - Similar to the overfitting examples, this example uses synthetic data generated within the code, so no external dataset is needed.

batch_normalization_example:
 - Batch normalization helps stabilize and speed up the training process by normalizing the output of layers. This example compares model performance with and without batch normalization.
 - This example shows how batch normalization can help maintain stable training by normalizing layer outputs. It’s especially useful for deeper networks.
 - Similar to the overfitting and dropout examples, this example uses synthetic data generated within the code, so no external dataset is needed.

data_augmentation_example:
 - Data augmentation generates variations of images in the dataset, making the model less likely to memorize the data. This example uses basic transformations like flipping, rotation, and zooming.
 - This script visualizes data augmentation by applying transformations to a single image. The tutorial explains how these techniques expand training data diversity, improving model generalization.
 - The CIFAR-10 dataset is a great choice for illustrating data augmentation techniques, as it contains 60,000 small images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cats, dogs, etc.). This dataset can be loaded directly in the code Data.lua. (https://github.com/Donotsharemypersonalinfo/Donotsharemypersonalinfo/blob/main/Data.lua)

real_life_application:
 - This script demonstrates a simple binary classification problem (e.g., distinguishing cats and dogs) using a neural network, introducing users to how neural networks apply to real-world problems.
 - This example applies neural networks to classify images, introducing users to how these models solve real-life problems. The example includes a simple CNN architecture suitable for beginners.
 - For the real-life example, you can also use CIFAR-10 if you want a quick setup. (https://github.com/Donotsharemypersonalinfo/Donotsharemypersonalinfo/blob/main/Data.lua)
